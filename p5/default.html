    Help i want to live in the Dance Dance Revolution universe but i am fundamentally inclined toward violence and destruction. Not in a sad way, well-- we’ll see. Anyway. I crave chaos at every millisecond i’m not indulging fully in the art of DDR, but they kicked me out because im actually just pure evil. Finally there is a special spot of saturated oblivion in the depths of Hell where i can be my true whole self and earn points to buy my way back to heaven and have a good shmooze with God about how messy life actually is--all to the tune of Andrew LLoyd Webber original rave anthems. Ya.. i told you it was HELL. bon night.

      Yesterday, in the gazebo it was decided that the screens would be used to strain our pasta unfortunately this means that all our of strainer needs have now been moved into the gazebo which also means that whenever i want to siffer /siffen some flower it’s necessary to set up the gazebo either in the kitchen or in the backyard. It’s been very confusing to organize the transportation of the stove to the outside when it’s nice out and we’d like to enjoy the weather. The other thing is the extension cords. We now have a whole wad of extension cords so we can bring any odd kitchen utensil back to the backyard so that it’s closer to the strainer. Now we’ve also had to bring a long hose for properly cleaning the lettuce. And well, yes, the remnants on the walls of the gazebo are very nice. When I get lost it’s always nice to follow the wires all the way back to the house. God forbid, I unplug the cord then I am not following the cord to the house but just pulling the cord close to me until i touch the end and have to find a new way back

      Wam bam ahaha wooooooooo did you know that’s the sound of lightning? Lightning actually makes a SOUND and that sound you hear is THUNDER. But there’s something about science or whatever that makes the sound come after lightning hits. I think the speed of light is faster then the speed of sound? When there was a thunderstorm (which happens quite frequently in ottawa during the summer) my mom used to count how far the storm actually was but counting the intervals between the lightning and the thunder clap. 1 one thousand, 2 one thousand, 3 one thousand. Boom. 1 one thousand, 2 one thousand, boom. 1 o- boom.
