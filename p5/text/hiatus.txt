After a 10 year hiatus, Ty Warner is back on the market, selling an exclusive line of Royal Wedding Beanie Babies. This new collection has cosmic novelty and each beanie baby can cost up to 1k a pop by the end of the millenia :-0. Introducing…. Kate Middleton and Prince William… modernized. Yes, darlings, with each purchase your “Royals” come with google glasses and a self-driving car that’ll skrrrrt them all the way to the buckingham palace for their Long Awaited Wedding Day. Turn on ur television at 3am EST and watch the magic happen ;-)
