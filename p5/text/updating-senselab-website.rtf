\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Before attempting to update an outdated or severely outdated instance of Wordpress, I would highly recommend performing the following steps :\uc0\u8232 \u8232 1. Launching the Softaculous Apps Installer tool available in your hosting account's control panel.\u8232 \u8232 2. Using that tool to create a backup of the website.\u8232 \u8232 3. Copying the resulting backup file which is created as a result of that action from the softaculous_backups folder in your hosting account's home directory to your hosting account's home directory itself. This is because it will get deleted from the softaculous_backups folder automatically in 3 days' time, by the server.\u8232 \u8232 If you did not install your website using Softaculous to begin with but did it manually, using the installer from the developer's website, then you'll first need to import the website into Softaculous.\u8232 \u8232 Kindly see the following Knowledge Base articles on how you can use Softaculous (which you can launch from under Software / Services in your cPanel) for installing CMSes, updating them, backing them up and restoring them :\u8232 \u8232 How to import your website into Softaculous (make Softaculous aware of a website script or CMS you installed manually outside of it, this doesn't change, move, rename, add or remove any files or folders to or from your website) :\u8232 \u8232 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.softaculous.com/docs/How_to_Import_an_Installation"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 https://www.softacul\'85/How_to_Import_an_Installation}}\uc0\u8232 \u8232 How to back up your website, for instance before updating it or performing any changes to it you might want to revert:\u8232 \u8232 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.softaculous.com/docs/How_to_Backup_an_Installation"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 https://www.softaculous.com/docs/How_to_Backup_an_Installation}}\uc0\u8232 \u8232 How to restore a previously created back-up :\u8232 \u8232 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.softaculous.com/docs/How_to_Restore_a_Backup"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 https://www.softaculous.com/docs/How_to_Restore_a_Backup}}\
You can even configure Softaculous to perform automatic, rotating backups of your website :\uc0\u8232 \u8232 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.softaculous.com/docs/Automated_Backups"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 https://www.softaculous.com/docs/Automated_Backups}}\
3:11 pm Additionally, you can even attempt to update your Wordpress website form outside of its Dashboard area, if you're no longer able to access that, likewise using the Softaculous Apps Installer tool.\uc0\u8232 \u8232 Please see the following article on how to update website installations to newer versions of their various respective scripts, such as Wordpress :\u8232 \u8232 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.softaculous.com/docs/How_to_upgrade_installations"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 https://www.softacul\'85s/How_to_upgrade_installations}}\
3:12 pm Finally, you can also attempt to update the website's installed plugins and themes using the Softaculous Apps Installer tool as well, as per the information in the following article :\uc0\u8232 \u8232 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://softaculous.com/docs/How_to_edit_an_installation"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 http://softaculous.c\'85cs/How_to_edit_an_installation}}\uc0\u8232 \u8232 This usually doesn't resolve website issues due to incompatibilities. But it has worked for me one a few occasions so it's worth a try.\
3:13 pm No update should be performed before the website has been backed up.\
