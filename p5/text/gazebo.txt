Yesterday, in the gazebo it was decided that the screens would be used to strain our pasta unfortunately this means that all our of strainer needs have now been moved into the gazebo which also means that whenever i want to siffer /siffen some flower it’s necessary to set up the gazebo either in the kitchen or in the backyard. It’s been very confusing to organize the transportation of the stove to the outside when it’s nice out and we’d like to enjoy the weather. The other thing is the extension cords. We now have a whole wad of extension cords so we can bring any odd kitchen utensil back to the backyard so that it’s closer to the strainer. Now we’ve also had to bring a long hose for properly cleaning the lettuce. And well, yes, the remnants on the walls of the gazebo are very nice. When I get lost it’s always nice to follow the wires all the way back to the house. God forbid, I unplug the cord then I am not following the cord to the house but just pulling the cord close to me until i touch the end and have to find a new way back
