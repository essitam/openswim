Help i want to live in the Dance Dance Revolution universe but i am fundamentally inclined toward violence and destruction. Not in a sad way, well-- we’ll see. Anyway. I crave chaos at every millisecond i’m not indulging fully in the art of DDR, but they kicked me out because im actually just pure evil. Finally there is a special spot of saturated oblivion in the depths of Hell where i can be my true whole self and earn points to buy my way back to heaven and have a good shmooze with God about how messy life actually is--all to the tune of Andrew LLoyd Webber original rave anthems. Ya.. i told you it was HELL. bon night.
