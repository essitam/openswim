(remembering some hebrew lyrics from my past)
Hava NEgila Hava Negila, hava negila, ve nismecha. Hava ne ranena hava ne renana Ha-bva - ne renanana ve nismecha OO ROO OO ROO HAVEEM roo haveem be nisameach roo haveem be nisameach (this is sung while evryone is dancing in a circle and holding hands doing the grapevine:)) (somebody gets lifted up on a chair at some point)
