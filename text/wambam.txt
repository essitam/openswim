Wam bam ahaha wooooooooo did you know that’s the sound of lightning? Lightning actually makes a SOUND and that sound you hear is THUNDER. But there’s something about science or whatever that makes the sound come after lightning hits. I think the speed of light is faster then the speed of sound? When there was a thunderstorm (which happens quite frequently in ottawa during the summer) my mom used to count how far the storm actually was but counting the intervals between the lightning and the thunder clap. 1 one thousand, 2 one thousand, 3 one thousand. Boom. 1 one thousand, 2 one thousand, boom. 1 o- boom.
