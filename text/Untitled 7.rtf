\f0\fs24 \cf0 I can\'92t stay stuck on any one taskleavinleavin jumping jumping jumping all of a sudden I realize the shoulders have been holding themselves together and then it is a lot to release a body and then I can\'92t stay in in in in so the I go and come in a matter of seconds but see when this happens its very exhausting and so this slow music presents a nice rythm and the frustration can be in that rhythm and I\'92m trying to land somewhere nice and soft and fun but I can\'92t find it and it might be because I drank coffee or because I got the wrong medications I had too much coffee too much acidic this morning. im feeling lonely I don\'92t know how to think I don\'92t know how to get past this place of not knowing I don\'92t know how to condense I don\'92t know how to not reiterate I wish I could think properly I wish things were more linear why is everything so much I should just do the thing immediately what if I couldthink and do at the same time}
